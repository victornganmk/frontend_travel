                            <h2>history</h2>
                            <p>Wellington, the capital city of New Zealand, is nestled at the southwestern tip of the North Island, boasting a compact urban layout surrounded by lush hills and a sparkling harbor. Often dubbed the "coolest little capital in the world," it blends natural beauty with creative energy, serving as the political, cultural, and economic hub of the nation. With a population of around 215,000 in the city proper and over 500,000 in the wider region, Wellington is renowned for its windy weather, innovative film industry, and world-class museums, making it a gateway for exploring New Zealand's diverse landscapes.</p>
                            <p>The city's history traces back to Māori settlement, with the area originally known as Te Whanganui-a-Tara, meaning "the great harbor of Tara," inhabited by iwi (tribes) like Te Āti Awa for centuries. European colonization began in 1839 when the New Zealand Company established its first organized settlement there, attracting British immigrants seeking new opportunities. Wellington was declared a city in 1840 and quickly grew amid challenges like earthquakes and land disputes. Initially, the colonial capital was in the Bay of Islands, then moved to Auckland in 1841. By 1865, due to its central location and to balance North-South Island tensions, Wellington replaced Auckland as the capital, with Parliament first convening there on July 26 that year. The late 19th century saw rapid development, including infrastructure improvements and its establishment as a business center by the 1930s. Through the 20th century, it evolved into a modern metropolis, overcoming events like the 1855 earthquake, and today commemorates its 150 years as capital with a strong sense of identity tied to governance and innovation. This historical foundation has shaped Wellington into a resilient, forward-thinking city that honors its indigenous roots while embracing global influences.</p>

                            <p>Central to Wellington's cultural landscape is Te Papa Tongarewa, the Museum of New Zealand, which houses over two million artifacts exploring the country's natural history, Māori taonga (treasures), and Pacific cultures through interactive exhibits. The film industry shines brightly here, as the hometown of director Peter Jackson, with "Wellywood" studios producing blockbusters like The Lord of the Rings, drawing visitors to tours and attractions. Heritage sites abound, including the Wellington Museum, which delves into maritime history, and historic settlements showcasing colonial architecture. Māori cultural experiences are integral, with opportunities to visit marae (meeting grounds), witness haka performances, and engage in traditional arts at venues like Te Papa.</p>
                            <p>The city's attractions extend to nature-infused culture, such as Zealandia Te Māra a Tāne, an ecosanctuary restoring native wildlife, blending environmental education with outdoor adventures. Culinary culture thrives on Cuba Street's eclectic cafes and craft breweries, while events like the New Zealand Festival of the Arts and World of WearableArt highlight innovation in performing arts and fashion. Waterfront strolls, Mount Victoria viewpoints, and the iconic cable car offer scenic backdrops to this cultural immersion.

                            <h2>geography</h2>
                            <p>Wellington is located in Oceania, New Zealand, situated on the Cook Strait, where the North and South Islands converge, featuring a natural harbor surrounded by steep, green hills. The city spans about 290 square kilometers with rugged terrain, and fault lines make it prone to earthquakes, shaping its resilient urban design. Known as the windiest city globally, it experiences strong winds funneled through the strait, with average speeds exceeding 25 km/h, influencing its climate and architecture. Nearby are native forests, coastal trails, and Otari-Wilton’s Bush, the only public botanic garden dedicated to New Zealand plants. The adjacent Remutaka and Tararua ranges offer hiking opportunities, while the harbor supports marine activities, though occasional fog occurs.</p>
                            <p>The climate is temperate maritime, mild year-round: summers (December to February) average 20°C, while winters (June to August) range from 11-13°C, with monthly rainfall of 100-120 mm. There are no extreme conditions, but wind and rain can make it feel cooler. The best time to visit is summer (late December to early March), when warm, sunny weather is ideal for harbor cruises, hill walks, and festivals. This peak season offers vibrant events and stable weather. Spring (September-November) and autumn (March-May) have fewer crowds, blooming gardens, or colorful foliage, perfect for visiting Wairarapa wineries. Winter is wetter and windier, suited for indoor activities like museum visits, with fewer tourists and lower costs. Wellington’s geography is most appealing in warmer months, but its year-round accessibility suits varied travel preferences.</p>
